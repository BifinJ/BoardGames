# 🎮 Turn Order & Playing

## First Turn
- Players decide who breaks first (coin toss or mutual agreement).
- The player breaking uses the striker to try and pocket coins.

## Turn Progression
- A player continues to play as long as they keep pocketing their assigned coins.
- Once they fail to pocket a coin or commit a foul, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Striking Rules
- Striker must be placed within the baseline area.
- Must be flicked with a single finger.
- Should not touch outside the baseline before striking.

# 👑 The Queen

## How to Cover
- The queen must be pocketed and then followed by a successful pocket of one of the player's coins (covering it) in the same or next turn.

## Failing to Cover
- If the player fails to cover the queen:
  - The queen is returned to the center.
  - The player's turn ends.

## Winning with Queen
- To win, the queen must be pocketed and covered, and then all assigned coins must be pocketed.
