# üîê Special Moves

## Castling
- A combined move with the king and a rook.
- Conditions:
  - Neither piece has moved before.
  - No pieces between them.
  - The king is not in, through, or ending in check.
- The king moves two squares toward the rook, and the rook jumps to the other side.

## En Passant
- A special pawn capture.
- Conditions:
  - An opposing pawn moves two squares from its start, landing beside your pawn.
  - You may capture it as if it moved only one square.
  - Must be done on the very next move.

## Pawn Promotion
- When a pawn reaches the opponent‚Äôs back rank:
  - It is promoted to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight (player‚Äôs choice).
  - Promotion happens regardless of what pieces remain on the board.
